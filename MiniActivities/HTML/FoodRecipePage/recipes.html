                    <summary>Ingredients for crispy oven baked quesadillas</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Mesh Potatoes</b> ‚Äì This recipe will work good with some of the boiled potatoes, meshed perfectly for adding more crisp to the taco shells and all!.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Tomato paste</b> ‚Äì This is to add a little flavour, bind the filling and juice it up a bit. Without, the mesh potatoes is a little dry and crumbly, I find.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Taco seasoning</b> ‚Äì This is the blend I use for my Taco Filling, made with simple pantry staples. If you‚Äôre tempted to use a store bought packet for convenience, go ahead. But when you have time, use this homemade mix and notice how it doesn‚Äôt have that artificial edge! I think you‚Äôll enjoy it. üôÇ</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Corn and beans</b> ‚Äì This is to add some bulk and different texture into the filling, rather than just using meat. I use canned, though you can use frozen corn as well. (Use leftovers in a salad or freeze flattered in ziplock bags so you can snap off a bit more the next time you make this!).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Flour tortillas</b> ‚Äì Use flour tortillas around 20cm/8‚Ä≥ wide. I‚Äôve tried this with all sorts of brands from and they all baked up lovely and crispy with the exception of Old El Paso. These tortillas labelled as ‚Äúsuper soft and flexible!‚Äù which works against us here! They do go quite crispy but they take an extra 3 to 5 minutes, but still not as crispy as all the other brands I tried (Mission, Coles and Woolworths brands, La Banderita).Whatever brand you can get, I still think this is still worth making. Firstly, it‚Äôs quick. Secondly, even if not as ultra crispy as pictured, it should crisp up a decent amount and it will be a tasty trial-and-error to find the tortilla brand that works best.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Cheese </b>‚Äì Use any melting cheese you want. I use Colby, cheddar, tasty cheese (an Australian cheddar-like cheese) and Monterey Jack, all of which are staples in my fridge. I wouldn‚Äôt choose to use mozzarella as it doesn‚Äôt have as much flavour but if that‚Äôs all I had, it wouldn‚Äôt stop me.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Olive oil</b> ‚Äì You need it, if you want crispy! Just 1 teaspoon to grease the tray and some for the quesadillas ( just 1/2 teaspoon each).</li></li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>

                    <summary>How to make crispy oven baked quesadillas</summary>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Mesh Potaoto filling</b> Mesh the potatoes first, breaking it up as you. Then when the red (raw) colour is just about gone, add the Taco Seasoning and cook it for 1 minute which will bring out the flavour. Add the tomato paste and stir for another 1 minute to cook off the sour raw flavour. Stir in the corn, beans and water. The water will ‚Äújuice up‚Äù the filling a bit without making it watery (which will compromise crispiness).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Cool</b> the filling for 15 minutes. If it‚Äôs too hot, it will steam inside the quesadillas which makes the tortilla soggy = compromises crispiness (do you see a theme in today‚Äôs recipe? üòÇ).This is what we‚Äôre after ‚Äì not dry and crumbly, but it‚Äôs not watery:</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Assemble quesadillas </b> ‚Äì Spread the filling across half of each quesadilla and top with cheese. Spread evenly to make the quesadillas as flat as possible.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Prepare for baking</b> ‚Äì Grease a tray with olive oil (just 1 teaspoon is enough), then place the quesadillas on the tray. Drizzle the surface with oil then spread across the surface and sides (I use my hands). Oil is essential for oven baked crispiness. Don‚Äôt be tempted to skimp on the oil!</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Double flip bake </b> ‚Äì Bake in a hot oven (220¬∞C / 425¬∞F (200¬∞C fan-forced)) for 8 minutes. Flip, bake for 5 minutes, then flip again and bake for a further 2 minutes or until it is golden and crispy. The third flip is key! The tortilla gets stained with red oil from the beef which crisps up beautifully, and it‚Äôs extra tasty.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Serve </b>immediately! Cut the quesadillas in half then serve with your dipping sauce / toppings of choice. </li>
                        <br>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Prep:</b> Trim the stem/spine of the collard leaf ‚Äì don‚Äôt cut it completely off, but just cut it down so that it‚Äôs nice and thin and pliable.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Roll:</b> Arrange your fillings on the collard leaf. Fold the ends in and roll from front to back, trying to keep everything in there nice and tight. Watch video for a visual example.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Peanut Sauce: </b> un all the ingredients through a blender or food processor. Voila!</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p></p><b>Note:</b>You can steam the collard leaves if you want to make them more pliable. I also found that just running the leaf under hot water or placing hot rice on it was enough to soften it just a little bit. These aren‚Äôt the greatest for making ahead, since the hummus can get a little watery once it sits with the veggies. I recommend prepping everything and then keeping it in the fridge and rolling a fresh one each morning or just before you eat it. They will hold together nicely with toothpicks! For a completely sugar free version of this recipe, use white distilled vinegar.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Initial Process</b> Season the chicken cavity with salt and place it on a rotisserie (tie the wings and legs if you have twine or string available). Set the grill on high and cook for 10 minutes. Turn the grill down to medium and baste with a mixture of the butter and the seasonings. Close the lid and continue cooking, basting occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. The internal temperature should reach at least 180 degrees F.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>After step</b> A cooked rotisserie chicken should stay good for about four days in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Cut Rotisserie Chicken</b> 
                            <ul>
                            <li>Place the chicken, breast-side up, on a cutting board.</li>
                            <li>Pull one of the legs away from the body and slice through the meat until the hip bone is exposed. Then, pull the leg harder until the leg is detached.</li>
                            <li>Use your knife to separate the drumstick and thigh.</li>
                            <li>Pull the wing tip away from the breast until you can easily cut through the joint.</li>
                            <li> Slice one of the breasts away from the breastbone. Repeat with the other breast.</li>
                        </ul></li>
